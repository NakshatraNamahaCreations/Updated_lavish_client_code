            question: "What is a Time Slot?", 
            answer: "If you need the decoration ready by 2PM, select the 12-2 PM slot. We recommend booking early, as slots fill up quickly."

            question: "What if my slot is unavailable? Can I book for the same day?", 
            answer: "Yes, we accommodate urgent requests. WhatsApp us at +91xxxxxxxxxx, and our team will do their best to arrange your decoration."

            question: "When will decorators come and how much time is required for decoration?", 
            answer: "Decorators will come at the selected time slots. For example, if you select a 4-6 PM slot, they will arrive by 4 or 4:30, and by 6 PM, it will be done. For simple decorations, 1-2 hours; for bigger decorations, 2-3 hours max." 
        },
        { 
            question: "How will I know if my order is confirmed?",

        },
        { 
            question: "How many people will come?",

            question: "Can I change my time slot after booking?", 
            answer: "Yes, you can request a time slot change up to 6 hours before your scheduled slot. However, changes are subject to availability." 
        },
        { 
            question: "Do I need to arrange anything for decorators?", 
            answer: "No, our team carries all the necessary materials. Only a small tool or chair may be required, and sometimes access to an electric socket may be needed." 
        },
        { 
            question: "Is Lavishevents a Trusted Brand?", 
            answer: "Yes, we are Bangalore's No.1 balloon decoration service for the past X years. Search 'Balloon decoration' in the city, and you will find Lavishevents on top. We have served over 10k+ customers across Bangalore, and daily we do more than X+ decorations across the city." 
        },
        { 
            question: "How long will the decoration last?", 
            answer: "The decoration will last for several hours, depending on the type and materials used. Generally, balloon decorations last around 8-12 hours. However, factors like air conditioning and humidity may affect this." 
        },
        { 
            question: "Do you offer Cash-on-Delivery (COD)?", 
            answer: "We do not offer COD as decoration is a customized service for each user. However, you can confirm your booking with a 50% advance payment and pay the rest after the decoration is completed." 
        },
        { 
            question: "Can I customize my decorations?",

        },
        { 
            question: "Can I keep all the materials with us after decoration?", 
            answer: "Yes, all decoration materials remain with you. However, rental items like focus lights, metal stands, and vases will be collected the next day." 
        },
        { 
            question: "I am getting a lower price quote from another brand?", 
            answer: "Yes, we ensure premium, safe materials for all decorations, unlike local decorators who may reuse or use low-quality items. Our pricing reflects quality and timely service, but you can WhatsApp us for the best quote."
