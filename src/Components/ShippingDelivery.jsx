        We use reliable third-party courier services to deliver our products.
        While we strive to ensure timely delivery, we do not guarantee delivery
        times and are not responsible for delays caused by the shipping provider
        or unforeseen circumstances. You will be notified of the estimated
        delivery timeline at the time of purchase. All the orders will be
        dispatched in 3-4 business days and will be delivered in
        7-10 business days.
